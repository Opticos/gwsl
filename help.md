## GWSL Shortcuts Not Working After The recent update (1.3.9 or 1.4.0)?
* I believe this is due to a new Windows bug but I am not sure.
* To fix the problem, go to Windows Settings --> Apps --> Apps & Features --> App Execution Aliases, and toggle GWSL off and back on.
* Still no success? See below, you may have another issue.
