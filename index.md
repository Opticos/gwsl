## GWSL

### What on Earth does this do? What is it for? How can it help me?

GWSL Lets you easily run graphical Linux apps on Windows 10 . . . *AND* it lets you run graphical applications located on *remote* Linux machines on Window 10 . . . *AND* it lets you manage these apps graphicaly, create Windows shortcuts for them, customize these shortcuts, and even manage/configure WSL distros! All at the click of a button! No memorization of commands necessary! *Easy!!!*

Bascially, it does alot of stuff so *you* don't have to! Maybe you'd better watch the video ↓

### Wait... Why is it called GWSL? From your title it looks like it should be called TFPHIWXS. Why didn't you call it that?

Meh... That doesn't sound too great. GWSL stands for Graphical WSL. WSL in turn stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux. :-)

### Great. But there are other XServers for Windows. Why should I use GWSL?

There are several alternative XServers for Windows 10. Some are proprietary (and costly). Some have not been updated for years. 

GWSL is Free.

GWSL Builds on the VCXSRV XServer, one of the best open source Windows Xservers. GWSL uses VCXSRV as a backend but adds many useful features. 

### System Requirements

Windows 10 Version 2004
